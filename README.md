# Features

This project tested my knowledge of mongoDB as well as mongoose. I had a few problems with the pathing in the server.js to work with the exercise html page but it ended up being a simple fix. You are able to create a new workout, add to that workout, complete the workout, or start a workout all over. It displays the date, duration, exercises, distance, weight, sets and reps.
